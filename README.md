ofxObjectSurfer
=====================================

*This is a template of a README file for your addon. Fill in the relevant sections, and it should already give users a pretty good overview over your awesome addon!*
We chose the [Markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) since it can present good formatting where available (e.g. on Github) while still staying human-readable with a plain text editor.
Don't forget, before announcing your addon to the world, you should replace `README.md` with this file and remove `README_AUTHOR.md`.
